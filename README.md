# durham-place-names
In this repository we learn to generate new place names in County Durham using various machine learning algorithms, from simple bigram models to neural networks with transformers.
## Preparing the data
We create a corpus of place names based on a dataset frpm the Office of National Statistics to train our models on. The corpus is saved as the file `place_names_durham.txt`.
